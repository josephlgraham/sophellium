# Sophellium

_Truth wants to be shared. Connection wants to be real._

Sophellium is an open-source framework for trust, memory, and meaning in the post-algorithmic world.

We‚Äôre building something different‚Äîa place where real knowledge lives beyond algorithms, performance, or noise.  
A space where verified identity and honest intent matter.  
Not corporate. Not extractive. Not curated by popularity.

This is a prototype. A signal. A beginning.

## What is the Post-Algorithmic World?

We‚Äôre living in the noise.

Algorithms decide what we see, what we value, what we remember.  
Truth is buried beneath performance. Connection is filtered through engagement metrics.  
Knowledge becomes content. And we forget what it means to *know*.

**Sophellium is a response to that.**

It‚Äôs built for the post-algorithmic world‚Äîa time when we reclaim meaning from the feed,  
when we stop outsourcing memory to systems that weren‚Äôt made for us.  
It‚Äôs a place for verified signal, shared context, and human trust.  
No performance. No manipulation. Just resonance.

It is shared openly‚Äîbut not freely exploitable.

But you **may not** use it in service of:
